# L19 Nuclear energy

Week 11, Tuesday


## Material covered and references


* We will first work on the Convection notebook from last week. 

--


We discuss the main source of energy in the Sun: thermonuclear reactions.

We first discuss the principle behind nuclear fusion, related to the nucleus binding energy. We looked at the binding energy per nucleons: how much energy per units of mH is released by fusing N hydrogen nucleus into the corresponding bigger nucleus.


Once we get this energy released per reaction, we can find our power generated per unit of mass (epsilon in our energy conservation equation) if we know the rate of reaction. From simple calculations, we estimate that there should be 10E38 reactions per second for the Sun.

>* Leblanc 6.2 for the nuclear binding energy. 
>* Leblanc 6.4 for the qualitative explanation of the Colomb repulsion. 
>* (Leblanc 6.3 Models of the nucleus -- interesting, but we won't go in that much details about the strong force)
>
>* Hansen 6.2.2 had the figure of Q/A that I discussed in the slides. The physics in the text is however more detailed that what we covered. 
>* If you are interested in the details of the nuclear rate calculations, Henson 6.2.3 has the best description. However, the concept of the Gammov peak is better illustrated in Kip 18.3.
