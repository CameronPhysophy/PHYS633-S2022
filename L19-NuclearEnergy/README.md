We discuss the main source of energy in the Sun: thermonuclear reactions.

We first discuss the principle behind nuclear fusion, related to the nucleus binding energy. We looked at the binding energy per nucleons: how much energy per units of mH is released by fusing N hydrogen nucleus into the corresponding bigger nucleus.


Once we get this energy released per reaction, we can find our power generated per unit of mass (epsilon in our energy conservation equation) if we know the rate of reaction. From simple calculations, we estimate that there should be 10E38 reactions per second for the Sun.
