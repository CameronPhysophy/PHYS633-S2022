# How to submit notebooks in Canvas

1. Rename your notebook using this naming convention: <br> `Lastname_Firstname_LXX-nameofnotebook.ipynb` <br> you can add a "-revise" at the end of your revised notebooks, if you'd like.
2. Download you notebook to your computer using the **Colab menu** (and not the browser menu) <br> `File > Download > Download .ipynb`
3. Check the size of your downloaded file -- if it is 1kB only, it means that you used the browser menu instead of the Colab menu in step #2. 
4. In Canvas, use the upload file option in the assignement.
