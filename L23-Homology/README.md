# L23 Homology

Week 13, Tuesday


## Material covered and references


Today, we will explore a solution to the equations of stellar structure using homology relations. 

First, we will express the 4 differential equations using the enclosed mass as the coordinate system instead of the radius (for example, we will talk about instead of r(M_r) instead of M_r(r)).

Then, we will assume that the four quantities involved in the differential equations (r, P, T, and L_r) all have the same functional variation with a dimensionless mass coordinate (q = M_r/Mstar), but scaled to a certain power of the total mass. For example, the pressure could be expressed as: P(q) = Mstar^(a_P) * tilde(P).

From this, we found a set of 4 equations that relates the density, the opacity, and the nuclear reaction power to the 4 power coefficients. 

We can also use the relationship between density, opacity, nuclear reaction and the four main quantities. For example, the ideal gas law tells us that rho proportional to P/T. From these, we can solve for the power coefficients.

Once we found these coefficients, we are able to find relation between the mass of a star and e.g. its luminosity, temperature, pressure, and radial coordinate. 

We also had to find an expression for the effective temperature, as the temperature variation doesn't directly give us the effective temperature (remember, the effective temperature is the temperature that a blackbody with the same flux would have). 

Once we found the effective temperature, we were able to put our prediction on a HR diagram, and compare with the real position of the main sequence.
