# How is your work graded in this course

## Portfolio (60%)

It is my strategy to assign short, but very frequent exercises for you to work on outside of class. These will revolve around Python Notebooks (on Google Colab, which can be used in the browser and free). These notebooks are an ideal tool for course activities, as they allow both code and formatted explanatory text to co-exist. 

During each lecture, we will work on a Python Notebook together to perform some simple calculations, solve a problem, and/or produce graphs to explore a concept.  

Outside of class, you will have to complete the notebook, and solve additional problems. 

Your collection of notebooks will become your course "portfolio". 

 

The portfolio will be evaluated in a two-step process. You have ~1 week to complete each notebook. I will then take 3-4 days (depending on the size of the class) to look over them, and provide feedback on any problems, mistakes, missing items, etc. You then will have about a week to submit a revised version, if needed.  
 

The evaluation of your portfolio will be made with the following grading scheme:

* A (4 pts): Waow! Looks even better than mine! 
* B (3 pts): Things are all in, and the presentation is good.
* C (2 pts): The essential is in, but it needs some work.
* D (1 pt):  I need to work very hard to follow what's going on.
* F (0 pt): Portfolio was not submitted.

### How and when to submit your work

As this is a graduate course, the deadlines can be somewhat flexible. 
The main reason I set deadlines is to motivate you to complete the tasks in a reasonable timeframe to get the most of the course (so that you do not feel at loss with newer material), and to help me manage and spread out looking over your material to give you timely feedback and to then assess your work and that of your classmates (there are 20 of you, but only one of me :) 

If you need an extension on a due date, email me and explain what you need. It helps if you propose a concrete new deadline (e.g. ("I can get this to you by tomorrow at 11:59pm"). If you ask for a lot of extensions, we'll work together to find ways to help you keep up. 

There is a canvas assignement for each python notebook. In previous instances of this course, students would save their notebook to PDFs and upload them to Canvas. But as we are now using Google Colab for the first time, there might be a better way to go about this. Canvas allows to submit links (shared from Colab) or google documents from your Drive (which hopefully will include the Colab notebooks) -- I suggest that we give this a try and see how it goes!

## Mid-term & Final (20% & 20%)

Both mid-term and final examinations will be oral and one-to-one. A week before the exam, I will post a list of questions (conceptual and problems) covering the material. During your examination, you will draw a set of questions and answer them -- this is similar to a thesis proposal or thesis defense, but knowing the questions that can be asked in advance. 

During the final, some of the questions will allow you to show me figures or calculation from your portfolio. 

The evaluation of each questions will be made with the following scheme:

* A (4pts): Perfect. Student was able to answer the questions and follow-up questions.
* B (3 pts): The student was able to answer most of the question, but needed a hint or a quick correction.
* C (2 pts): The student needed to to pointed in the right direction a few times. 
* D (1 pts): The student had to be walked through the solution, but demonstrated some understanding of each individual steps.
* F (0 pt): Even with the help provided, the student was not able to answer the question.
