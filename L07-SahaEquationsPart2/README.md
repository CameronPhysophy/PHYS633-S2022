# L06 Saha Equations Part 2

Week 4, Tuesday


## Material covered and references

During the last lecture, we found a system of equation that allow us to solve for the ionization fraction of each ionization levels. We then explicitly wrote these equations for the case of hydrogen.

We will discuss briefly an issue with the partition function, which goes to infinity is we consider an infinite number of energy level. We fix this problem by invoking a maximum bound energy level, that will depend on the pressure. The physical basis of this "fix" is that for a non isolated atom, the very large energy levels will be perturbed by the presence of nearby charges (resulting in "pressure ionization" in the most extreme cases).

Now, we look at what these equations will look like if you have a mixture of various elements, each of which can have more than one ionization stage. I demonstrated the case of H + He.

We found out that if one knew E = ne/nion, the set of equation "1" through "2" is linear. Therefore we can solve for the ionization fractions, and put them in equation "3" (charge conservation that relates E with the ionization fractions and the known mass fractions) to calculate the E associated with our resulting fractions. If the E we get is different than the one we assumed, it means that our estimate was wrong, and we can keep trying different values of E until we find the right one.
