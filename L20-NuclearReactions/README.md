# L20 Nuclear reaction rates

Week 11, Thursday


## Material covered and references


Today, we will compare the reaction rates from the pp-chain and the cno-cycle, in the interior of a 1 Msun star and a 10 Msun star.

> In the [textbooks](../textbooks.md):
> 

>* Leblanc 6.5.1 and 6.5.2 for detailed description of the PP chain and the CNO cycle. Pay attention to Figure 6.7. 
>* (Note: Leblanc 6.7 has some interesting details about the advanced burning stages, e.g. triple-alpha reaction for He burning, etc)
>* Kip 18.5.1 for the rate equations parametrized by T, composition, etc. Pay attention to Fig. 18.8.
