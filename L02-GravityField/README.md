## Material covered and references

We discussed two mathematical concepts that will be very important in this course:

The number of quantities that can be determined or constrained
depends on the number of equations.
In this course we will always be doing definite integrals
meaning that <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\int_1^2 dF = F_2 - F_1">.
When solving differential equation (means taking the integral on both sides
of the equation), the bounds need to match physically. They won't necessarily
have the same value on each side.

We discussed the gravity field inside of a star. We found an expression for
the necessary enclosed mass, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=$M_r$">, for a defined, but variable density

"What-if?" What if we used the enclosed mass at the surface as our boundary condition?
