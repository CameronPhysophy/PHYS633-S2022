How to systematically solve for the pressure somewhere inside of the star for a
known density variation, by integrating the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium
and noting that the pressure should be null at the "surface" of the star.
***(Remember to pay attention to your integral bounds!!)***

As another "what-if?", Leblanc uses the central pressure as the boundary
condition instead of the surface pressure in his example 5.1 if you are curious.

Python skills:

* Practice adding curves to graphs, and add legends.
* Learn more about the Astropy Constants and Units packages

## Supplemental problems suggestions:

* Hanson Prob. 1.3 and Leblanc Prob. 5.1 ask some further questions
about the decreasing density model.

* Leblanc Prob. 2.1 asks for $P(r)$ for an atmosphere (pay attention to your boundaries)
