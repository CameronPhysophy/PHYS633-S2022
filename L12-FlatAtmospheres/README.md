# L12 Flat Atmospheres

Week 6, Thursday


## Material covered and references

We applied the formal solution of RT to a semi-infinite, flat atmosphere. We found an expression for the in-going (u<0) and out-going (u>0) rays. 
In the case of the Sun, we are able to measure the emergent intensity (tau = 0) as a function of u. This can therefore be used to constrain the source function and hence the temperature. 

By using a simple approximation that the source function is linear with the optical depth, we found the the I(tau=0, u) = S( tau=u). This implied that rays coming from the center of the Sun's projected disk (u=1) in the sky are brighter that the rays coming from the sides (u=0). This phenomenon is called Limb-Darkening.

Therefore by measuring Limb-Darknening, we can put constrains on the temperature structure at various optical depth. Furthermore, as the optical depth is a function of wavelength, the spatial location of e.g. tau=1 will be different for different wavelength. Measurements of Limb-Darkening at various wavelengths thus enables a good estimate of the temperature structure of the Sun's atmosphere.
