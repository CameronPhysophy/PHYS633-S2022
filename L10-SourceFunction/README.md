* The formal solution of the radiative transfer equation. This solution is expressed in terms of the optical depth, and make use of a quantity called the source function ( = j/k, and has units of intensity).
 
* The source function is what the intensity will become after going through a number of optical depth. Of course, the intensity might not be able to become equal to the source function, if the source function itself varies significantly over a few optical depth.
