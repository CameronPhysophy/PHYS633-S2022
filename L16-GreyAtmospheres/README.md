# L16 Grey atmospheres

Week 9, Thursday


## Material covered and references


* Using the results from the large optical depth (J ~ 3K), we can now solve our system of equations to find the temperature structure. 
* Because we used the results from the large optical depth approximation, we introduced a correction factor q(tau). This factor can be found iteratively based on the mean intensity relation with the source function. 
* But we will use again results from the large optical depth case to estimate a value of q, with will be ~ 2/3.
* In the notebook, we compare our estimated model for the temperature structure with the 'real' temperature structure of the sun.

We also find an expression for the wavelength dependent flux (i.e. the spectrum!) that our estimated model predicts. 

We are doing this with a worksheet first for the math, and then in the notebook you will compare this with the real solar flux spectrum.
